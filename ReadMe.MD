This is a simple addon that randomizes your mounts.

Rather than using the command '/mount <mount_name>', you would just use '/mount'.  When '/mount' is used without a name argument, the addon will select a random mount from those that you own.

Future Plans:

Selecting mounts from those currently owned to be whitelisted and/or blacklisted from roulette.
